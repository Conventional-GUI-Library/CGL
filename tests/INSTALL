  % gzip -cd gtk+-3.2.4.tar.gz | tar xvf - # unpack the sources
  % cd gtk+-3.2.4                          # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure                                    # run the `configure' script
  % make                                           # build GTK+
  [ Become root if necessary ]
