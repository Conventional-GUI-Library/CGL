/**
 * SECTION:gtkactionable
 * @title: GtkActionable
 * @short_description: an interface for widgets that can be associated
 *                     with actions
 *
 * This interface provides a convenient way of associating widgets with
 * actions on a #GtkApplicationWindow or #GtkApplication.
 *
 * It primarily consists of two properties: "action-name" and
 * "action-target".  There are also some convenience APIs for setting
 * these properties.
 *
 * This interface is presently only meaningful if used on a widget that
 * is (or will be) located inside of a #GtkApplicationWindow and can
 * only be used to associate the widget with actions on that window, or
 * its associated #GtkApplication.
 *
 * Since: 3.4

 * If @target_value is %NULL then the target value is unset.
 *
 * The target value has two purposes.  First, it is used as the
 * parameter to activation of the action associated with the
 * #GtkActionable widget.  Second, it is used to determine if the widget
 * should be rendered as "active" -- the widget is active if the state
 * is equal to the given target.
 *
 * Consider the example of associating a set of buttons with a #GAction
 * with string state in a typical "radio button" situation.  Each button
 * will be associated with the same action, but with a different target
 * value for that action.  Clicking on a particular button will activate
 * the action with the target of that button, which will typically cause
 * the action's state to change to that value.  Since the action's state
 * is now equal to the target value of the button, the button will now
 * be rendered as active (and the other buttons, with different targets,
 * rendered inactive).
