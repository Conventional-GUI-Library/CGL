 * @short_description: Application class
 *
 * #GtkApplication is a class that handles many important aspects
 * of a GTK+ application in a convenient fashion, without enforcing
 * a one-size-fits-all application model.
 *
 * Currently, GtkApplication handles GTK+ initialization, application
 * uniqueness, provides some basic scriptability by exporting 'actions',
 * and manages a list of toplevel windows whose life-cycle is automatically
 * tied to the life-cycle of your application.
 *
