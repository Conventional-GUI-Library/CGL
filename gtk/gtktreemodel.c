 * @Title: GtkTreeModel
 * @Short_description: The tree interface used by GtkTreeView
 * @See_also: #GtkTreeView, #GtkTreeStore, #GtkListStore,
 *     <link linkend="gtk-GtkTreeView-drag-and-drop">GtkTreeDnd</link>,
 *     #GtkTreeSortable
 *
 * The #GtkTreeModel interface defines a generic tree interface for
 * use by the #GtkTreeView widget. It is an abstract interface, and
 * is designed to be usable with any appropriate data structure. The
 * programmer just has to implement this interface on their own data
 * type for it to be viewable by a #GtkTreeView widget.
 *
 * The model is represented as a hierarchical tree of strongly-typed,
 * columned data. In other words, the model can be seen as a tree where
 * every node has different values depending on which column is being
 * queried. The type of data found in a column is determined by using
 * the GType system (ie. #G_TYPE_INT, #GTK_TYPE_BUTTON, #G_TYPE_POINTER,
 * etc). The types are homogeneous per column across all nodes. It is
 * important to note that this interface only provides a way of examining
 * a model and observing changes. The implementation of each individual
 * model decides how and if changes are made.
 *
 * In order to make life simpler for programmers who do not need to
 * write their own specialized model, two generic models are provided
 * &mdash; the #GtkTreeStore and the #GtkListStore. To use these, the
 * developer simply pushes data into these models as necessary. These
 * models provide the data structure as well as all appropriate tree
 * interfaces. As a result, implementing drag and drop, sorting, and
 * storing data is trivial. For the vast majority of trees and lists,
 * these two models are sufficient.
 *
 * Models are accessed on a node/column level of granularity. One can
 * query for the value of a model at a certain node and a certain
 * column on that node. There are two structures used to reference
 * a particular node in a model. They are the #GtkTreePath and the
 * #GtkTreeIter<footnote><para>Here, <abbrev>iter</abbrev> is short
 * for <quote>iterator</quote></para></footnote>. Most of the interface
 * consists of operations on a #GtkTreeIter.
 *
 * A path is essentially a potential node. It is a location on a model
 * that may or may not actually correspond to a node on a specific
 * model. The #GtkTreePath struct can be converted into either an
 * array of unsigned integers or a string. The string form is a list
 * of numbers separated by a colon. Each number refers to the offset
 * at that level. Thus, the path <quote>0</quote> refers to the root
 * node and the path <quote>2:4</quote> refers to the fifth child of
 * the third node.
 *
 * By contrast, a #GtkTreeIter is a reference to a specific node on
 * a specific model. It is a generic struct with an integer and three
 * generic pointers. These are filled in by the model in a model-specific
 * way. One can convert a path to an iterator by calling
 * gtk_tree_model_get_iter(). These iterators are the primary way
 * of accessing a model and are similar to the iterators used by
 * #GtkTextBuffer. They are generally statically allocated on the
 * stack and only used for a short time. The model interface defines
 * a set of operations using them for navigating the model.
 *
 * It is expected that models fill in the iterator with private data.
 * For example, the #GtkListStore model, which is internally a simple
 * linked list, stores a list node in one of the pointers. The
 * #GtkTreeModelSort stores an array and an offset in two of the
 * pointers. Additionally, there is an integer field. This field is
 * generally filled with a unique stamp per model. This stamp is for
 * catching errors resulting from using invalid iterators with a model.
 *
 * The lifecycle of an iterator can be a little confusing at first.
 * Iterators are expected to always be valid for as long as the model
 * is unchanged (and doesn't emit a signal). The model is considered
 * to own all outstanding iterators and nothing needs to be done to
 * free them from the user's point of view. Additionally, some models
 * guarantee that an iterator is valid for as long as the node it refers
 * to is valid (most notably the #GtkTreeStore and #GtkListStore).
 * Although generally uninteresting, as one always has to allow for
 * the case where iterators do not persist beyond a signal, some very
 * important performance enhancements were made in the sort model.
 * As a result, the #GTK_TREE_MODEL_ITERS_PERSIST flag was added to
 * indicate this behavior.
 *
 * To help show some common operation of a model, some examples are
 * provided. The first example shows three ways of getting the iter at
 * the location <quote>3:2:5</quote>. While the first method shown is
 * easier, the second is much more common, as you often get paths from
 * callbacks.
 *
 * <example>
 * <title>Acquiring a <structname>GtkTreeIter</structname></title>
 * <programlisting>
 *  /&ast; Three ways of getting the iter pointing to the location &ast;/
 * GtkTreePath *path;
 * GtkTreeIter iter;
 * GtkTreeIter parent_iter;
 *
 * /&ast; get the iterator from a string &ast;/
 * gtk_tree_model_get_iter_from_string (model, &amp;iter, "3:2:5");
 *
 * /&ast; get the iterator from a path &ast;/
 * path = gtk_tree_path_new_from_string ("3:2:5");
 * gtk_tree_model_get_iter (model, &amp;iter, path);
 * gtk_tree_path_free (path);
 *
 * /&ast; walk the tree to find the iterator &ast;/
 * gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &amp;iter, NULL, 3);
 * parent_iter = iter;
 * gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &amp;iter, &amp;parent_iter, 2);
 * parent_iter = iter;
 * gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &amp;iter, &amp;parent_iter, 5);
 * </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * This second example shows a quick way of iterating through a list
 * and getting a string and an integer from each row. The
 * <function>populate_model</function> function used below is not
 * shown, as it is specific to the #GtkListStore. For information on
 * how to write such a function, see the #GtkListStore documentation.
 *
 * <example>
 * <title>Reading data from a <structname>GtkTreeModel</structname></title>
 * <programlisting>
 * enum
 * {
 *   STRING_COLUMN,
 *   INT_COLUMN,
 *   N_COLUMNS
 * };
 *
 * ...
 *
 * GtkTreeModel *list_store;
 * GtkTreeIter iter;
 * gboolean valid;
 * gint row_count = 0;
 *
 * /&ast; make a new list_store &ast;/
 * list_store = gtk_list_store_new (N_COLUMNS, G_TYPE_STRING, G_TYPE_INT);
 *
 * /&ast; Fill the list store with data &ast;/
 * populate_model (list_store);
 *
 * /&ast; Get the first iter in the list &ast;/
 * valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (list_store, &amp;iter);
 *
 * while (valid)
 *  {
 *    /&ast; Walk through the list, reading each row &ast;/
 *    gchar *str_data;
 *    gint   int_data;
 *
 *    /&ast; Make sure you terminate calls to gtk_tree_model_get()
 *     &ast; with a '-1' value
 *     &ast;/
 *    gtk_tree_model_get (list_store, &amp;iter,
 *                        STRING_COLUMN, &amp;str_data,
 *                        INT_COLUMN, &amp;int_data,
 *                        -1);
 *
 *    /&ast; Do something with the data &ast;/
 *    g_print ("Row &percnt;d: (&percnt;s,&percnt;d)\n", row_count, str_data, int_data);
 *    g_free (str_data);
 *
 *    row_count++;
 *    valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (list_store, &amp;iter);
 *  }
 * </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * The #GtkTreeModel interface contains two methods for reference
 * counting: gtk_tree_model_ref_node() and gtk_tree_model_unref_node().
 * These two methods are optional to implement. The reference counting
 * is meant as a way for views to let models know when nodes are being
 * displayed. #GtkTreeView will take a reference on a node when it is
 * visible, which means the node is either in the toplevel or expanded.
 * Being displayed does not mean that the node is currently directly
 * visible to the user in the viewport. Based on this reference counting
 * scheme a caching model, for example, can decide whether or not to cache
 * a node based on the reference count. A file-system based model would
 * not want to keep the entire file hierarchy in memory, but just the
 * folders that are currently expanded in every current view.
 *
 * When working with reference counting, the following rules must be taken
 * into account:
 * <itemizedlist>
 * <listitem><para>Never take a reference on a node without owning a
 * reference on its parent. This means that all parent nodes of a referenced
 * node must be referenced as well.</para></listitem>
 * <listitem><para>Outstanding references on a deleted node are not released.
 * This is not possible because the node has already been deleted by the
 * time the row-deleted signal is received.
 * </para></listitem>
 * <listitem><para>Models are not obligated to emit a signal on rows of
 * which none of its siblings are referenced. To phrase this differently,
 * signals are only required for levels in which nodes are referenced. For
 * the root level however, signals must be emitted at all times (however the
 * root level is always referenced when any view is attached).
 * </para></listitem>
 * </itemizedlist>
