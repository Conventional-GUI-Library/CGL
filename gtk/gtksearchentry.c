/**
 * SECTION:gtksearchentry
 * @Short_description: An entry which shows a search icon
 * @Title: GtkSearchEntry
 *
 * #GtkSearchEntry is a subclass of #GtkEntry that has
 * been tailored for use as a search entry.
 *
 * It will show an inactive "find" icon when the
 * search entry is empty, and a "clear" icon when
 * there is text. Clicking on the "clear" icon will empty
 * the search entry.
 *
 * Note that the search/clear icon is shown using a secondary
 * icon, and thus does not work if you are using the secondary
 * icon position for some other purpose.
 *
 * Since: 3.6
